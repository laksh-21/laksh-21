Hi! i'm Laksh Chauhan, a Software Developer

I currently work as a full-time Software Developer working on backend development with Python and Java sparingly. We use MySQL as our database and use Flask with Gunicorn.

However, I have prior experience working with Java and AWS as well as Android development using Kotlin.
